**Power analysis for phosphopeptide abundance hypothesis tests via simulation.**

peppwR helps proteomics researchers answer critical experimental design questions:

- **"What sample size do I need?"** — Find the N required for 80% power to detect a given effect
- **"What's my power?"** — Calculate power for a given sample size and effect
- **"What can I detect?"** — Find the minimum detectable effect size for your design

## Features

- **Distribution fitting** — Fit gamma, lognormal, normal, and other distributions to pilot data
- **Per-peptide analysis** — Get power estimates across your entire peptidome
- **Multiple statistical tests** — Wilcoxon, bootstrap-t, and Bayes factor t-tests
- **Missing data handling** — Model MNAR (Missing Not At Random) patterns common in proteomics
- **FDR-aware mode** — Account for multiple testing correction in power calculations
- **Rich visualizations** — Power curves, heatmaps, QQ plots, and diagnostic plots

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("TeamMacLean/peppwR")
```

## Quick Start

### From Pilot Data (Per-Peptide Mode)

```{r example-pilot, eval=FALSE}
library(peppwR)

# Fit distributions to your pilot data
fits <- fit_distributions(
  pilot_data,
  id = "peptide",
  group = "condition",
  value = "abundance"
)

# Find required sample size for 80% power to detect 2-fold change
result <- power_analysis(
  fits,
  effect_size = 2,
  target_power = 0.8,
  find = "sample_size"
)

print(result)
#> Per-peptide power analysis
#> Question: sample_size
#> Answer: N = 6 per group
#> 73% of peptides achieve 80% power

plot(result)
```

### From Scratch (Aggregate Mode)

No pilot data? Specify assumed distribution parameters:

```{r example-aggregate, eval=FALSE}
result <- power_analysis(
  distribution = "gamma",
  params = list(shape = 2, rate = 0.1),
  effect_size = 2,
  target_power = 0.8,
  find = "sample_size"
)
```
