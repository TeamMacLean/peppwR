\title{Compute dataset-level MNAR metric}
\usage{
compute_dataset_mnar(missingness)
}
\arguments{
\item{missingness}{A tibble with columns na_rate and mean_abundance
(as produced by fit_distributions)}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item correlation: Spearman correlation coefficient (negative = MNAR pattern)
\item p_value: p-value for the correlation
\item n_peptides: Number of peptides with missing data used in calculation
\item interpretation: Human-readable interpretation string
}
}
\description{
Calculates Spearman correlation between log(mean_abundance) and NA rate
across peptides to detect whether low-abundance peptides have more missing
values than high-abundance peptides.
}
\section{MNAR Detection}{

MNAR (Missing Not At Random) in mass spectrometry typically manifests as
low-abundance peptides having higher rates of missing values due to
detection limits. This function detects this pattern by correlating
mean abundance with NA rate across all peptides.

A negative correlation indicates that low-abundance peptides have more
missing values - the hallmark of detection-limit-driven MNAR.
